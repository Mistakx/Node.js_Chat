Admins leaves the room permanently.
User hasn't joined any rooms.
User joins the same chat two times.
Two users with the same username.

Add user to room:
    User doesn't exist
    Room valid but doesn't exist
    Room invalid
    Room valid and exists

I think pretty much half of user inputs are unaccounted for at this point. Here's hoping they get the room IDs correct.
Small or empty passwords and usernames.

Sometimes the page refreshes before the changes are reflected in the database.
