Admins leaves the room permanently
User hasn't joined any rooms
User joins the same chat two times

Add user to room:
    User doesn't exist
    Room valid but doesn't exist
    Room invalid
    Room valid and exists

I think pretty much half of user inputs are unaccounted for at this point. Here's hoping they get the room IDs correct.
